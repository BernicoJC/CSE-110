Hi! My name is **Bernico**, and I am a **_second year_ CS Major at UCSD**. I came from Indonesia, and the way to pronounce my name is more akin to _bear-nee-koh_ ~~and almost no one here pronounced it correctly at first~~ .

I am in a pretty good position right now as a student here as I am able to get good grades and follow the classes I've taken so far without much issues. I would like to work in the states as either a software engineer or a game developer once I've graduated, though I am still not very sure about my life goal beyond this vague ideas.

My favorite quote to start my day is
> "What stands in the way becomes the way." - Marcus Aurelius

I like this quote as it is a very good motivator for me to face challenges in life.

Furthermore, here is [my favorite YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xm3YgoEiEDc).

Nice to meet you!

## My CS Profile

As you have probably known, my github account is [this](https://github.com/BernicoJC), where I showcase some of the projects I've done over the years.
[Here is the README.md of this repo.](README.md)

### "Weird" coding stuffs I do
For some reason I really like to do these habits, even though they might be very problematic. As such, I would like to dedicate this space as a task list of (probably) bad habits and which of them I do.
- [X] Putting if statements in one line like:
```
if(a == b) return x;
```
- [ ] Not remembering to save often.
- [X] Using `true` as the condition for every while loop I do:
```
while(true){
  if(exit) return true;
}
```
- [X] Using solely `print` statements to debug.
- [ ] Not putting comments on codes.

### How I got into CS

I know it's become a meme that `print("Hello World!")` is where everyone started. However, I started my interest with a very bad "_programming_" I did when I was a kid to make a "behavior pack for Minecraft Pocket Edition. Even though it was very basic, it very much planted the seed for me.
